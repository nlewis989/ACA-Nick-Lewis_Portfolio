                Hi my name is Nick Lewis and I am an aspiring web developer. I grew up in San Jose, California and moved to Austin in June of 2020.									
                I first became interested in coding when I was in highschoool and used to host a Garrys Mod server. I learned a little bit of a coding language called LUA and was able to										
                basically create a talent tree with the help of my friend who was more skilled and also leveling system so whenever a level is gained you recieve a talent tree point and										
                you could say put one of the points you earned into running faster or jumping higher  etc. I've always kinda been into games and how they work and Gmod was an										
                easier coding language for me to mess around with and have fun at the same time. I did not give much though of going to a school for coding until after a few years of community college.
                There we're no majors that really interested me and I felt that if I was going to go into a career for a long period of time then I should go down one I'd actually enjoy.
                Coding was the best option I could think of  and have now began a new chapter in my life and hope have a successful career in coding.
